The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is true and the ability to run some code repeatedly,
while a condition is true are basic building blocks in most programming languages. 
The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are if expressions and loops.

> control - flow means apke pass ek linear code h, aap chahte ho ki o cahle y n chale.
- means based of some conditions.
